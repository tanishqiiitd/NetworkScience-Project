# üì¶ E-Commerce Optimization using Network Science

A graph-powered framework for intelligent product recommendation, pricing sensitivity analysis, and influence modeling ‚Äî using the Amazon Co-Purchasing Network.

---

## üß† Project Overview

This project applies **network science techniques** to enhance e-commerce intelligence. Using the **Amazon0601 co-purchasing dataset (SNAP)**, we build graph models to deliver 5 key modules:

### üöÄ Deliverables

1. **Product Bundle Generator**  
   Uses **Louvain community detection** to cluster frequently co-purchased products for upselling and co-marketing.

2. **Sensitivity Matrix via Influence Diffusion**  
   Models pricing ripple effects across the product network using:  
   `S = Œ≤A + Œ≤Œ±A¬≤`  
   where `A` is the adjacency matrix, and `Œ≤`, `Œ±` are tunable influence weights.

3. **Fault-Tolerant Recommender System**  
   Identifies **backup recommendations** using 2-hop neighbors for the top 1000 high-degree products.

4. **Influence Simulation (Cascade Model)**  
   Runs a **probabilistic diffusion** from top betweenness centrality nodes to simulate viral marketing.

5. **Eigenvector Centrality-Based Product Ranking**  
   Ranks products by their recursive influence using eigenvector centrality. Visualizes top 20 influential products.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

Each deliverable code is in a jupyter notebook, just run them in a supported IDE.
